# TileVania
This is my 2d tile based platformer Game! Including gameplay, sound effect, and menus!
 
The code in this project was created with assistance from an instructor guided course on Udemy. On my own, I implemented menus, in game music, as well as the level layout design!
 
The goal of the game is to get past 3 levels that rise in difficulty. You want to get as many coins as you can while also shooting enemies that may be in the way. Make sure to avoid hazards such as spikes, water, and the enemies! Art and design was supplied through the Udemy Course.
